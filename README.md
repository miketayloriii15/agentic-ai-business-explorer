# Agentic AI Business Case 

This project demonstrates a multi-step conversation with the OpenAI API, framed as if a Fortune 500 business leader were evaluating opportunities for Agentic AI adoption. The script guides the model through structured prompts to identify business areas, explore pain points, and set the stage for potential solutions.

---

## Features
- Uses the **OpenAI Chat Completions API** (`gpt-4.1-mini`).
- Multi-turn conversation flow:
  1. Identify a business area that could benefit from Agentic AI.
  2. Append the modelâ€™s response to maintain context.
  3. Ask for a critical pain point in that industry that AI could address.
- Prints both the business idea and the identified pain point.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-business-explorer.git
cd agentic-ai-business-explorer
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install openai
3. Set your API key
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

Linux/macOS (bash/zsh):

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Windows (PowerShell):

powershell
Copy code
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Usage
Run the script from the command line:

bash
Copy code
python agentic_ai_business_case.py
Expected output will include:

Business Idea: one industry or function that can benefit from Agentic AI.

Pain Point: a costly, inefficient, or hard-to-scale challenge in that industry.

Example Output
pgsql
Copy code
=== Business Idea ===
Supply Chain Management could benefit from Agentic AI adoption by
optimizing logistics, forecasting demand, and reducing disruption risks.

=== Pain Point ===
A critical challenge is real-time disruption handling in global supply
chains, which often leads to costly delays. Agentic AI can proactively
monitor signals, predict issues, and autonomously re-route resources.
